## React App

Fully working app showing the most starred github repos at a particular date built with React.js/parcel. with pagination feature and 100% Responsive realized with pure CSS

I noticed that there are 30 items per page and the API provides only the first 1000 search results (items) per date which means the that page number 34 is last page after that ther is no more data in the next pages
