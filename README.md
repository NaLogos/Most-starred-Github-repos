#UNITED REMOTE Front-End Coding Challenge

this App is made using React JS Library

I will be using npm to bring in useful modules from it's registry, I just love this open source mindset huge thanks to all programmers writing awesome practical projects/tools for us to use, such as (can be found in devDependencies ):

    --React & React-DOM because these are the libraries I will be working with


    --Prettier & ESLint to ensure code quality


    --Parcel as a bundler, I'm aware of Webpack and it's a great piece of technology and i believe is more suitable for large applications ever since Parcel came out because it works with everything we want to do out of the box, which is convenient for me as a beginner

I noticed that ther are 30 items per page and the API provides only the first 1000 search results (items) per date which means the that page number 34 is last page after that ther is no more data in the next pages
